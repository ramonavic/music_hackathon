# Music Hackathon Project

###INFO

A scraper using the Nokogiri gem to retrieve artist data from different pages. The data will be added as a bookmark so that the user can keep track of his or her favourite artists. This hackathon project was created in 2 days. On [this page](https://tmf-revived.herokuapp.com) you can find an example hosted on Heroku.

Cool stuf we learned from this project include:
- Using Nokogiri and Net HTTP to scrape data as effective as possible
- Validate if data is present inside the view
- Using the Materialize parallax view
